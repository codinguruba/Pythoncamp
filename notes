1)What is variable?
Variables are containers for storing data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Syntax
name = "John"

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, 
which means that the data type of a variable is inferred at runtime based on the value assigned to it.

Question)
What is Interpreter and Compiler?
Interpreter Translates program one statement at a time.
Compiler Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.

2) What is Data types?
-
Python Data Types are used to define the type of a variable. It defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable.
Example - str , int, float , bool , list etc.

The type() function in Python can be used to determine the data type of a variable. 
For example, type(x) will return <class 'int'> if x is an integer.

3) What is Operators in python?
-In Python, operators are special symbols that perform arithmetic or logical computations on values or variables. 
Here are the most commonly used operators in Python:

a)Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)

b)Assignment Operators:
= (Simple assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)

c) Comparison Operators:
== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)



4)What is List?
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A list in Python is a collection of elements, which can be of any data type (such as integers, strings, or other objects
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

declaring List in python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5) if else in python?
In Python, the if-else statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. Here is the basic syntax:
if condition:
    # code to be executed if the condition is True
else:
    # code to be executed if the condition is False
    
 6) What is Boolean in python?
 In Python, a boolean is a data type that can only have two values: True or False. Boolean values are often used in programming as a way of
 representing logical or binary conditions, where a statement is either true or false.
